You take the good, you take the bad. You take them both, and there you have spiders crawling out of a red velvet cupcake.

Welcome to Night Vale. 

We start today’s show with some exciting agricultural news. John Peters – you know, the farmer? – said his winter orange crop is outstanding this year! He said there are oranges everywhere! Delicious clementines, juicy Valencias, rich navels, and bold blood oranges.

John said there are so many oranges, “a real bumper crop,” he said. “A real orange-tacular,” he did notsay. “A real orange-a-thon,” he never would have said. “A real orange-ocalypse,” he may have thought, but kept to himself.

John, speaking to a pack of local reporters, and backed by a group of farmers wearing black double-breasted suits and red silk ties, said this is the dawning of a new citrus economy in Night Vale.

John said, “Citrus is our future. Citrus holds the key to prosperity. Citrus holds the key to health. One particular orange here literally holds the key to a one-sided door in the middle of the desert. If you find that orange,” John said, “I will pay you dearly for it.”

“Or rather,” John corrected himself, “you will pay dearly for it.”

Then John said, “Either way, whatever. Would love to have that orange, my friend. Would love to have that orange. Yessir!” he punctuated. “Or ma’am. Or neither. I mean, whoever. Sure would love to have that orange,” he chuckled while sweating and adjusting his wooden hat.

John then tossed some oranges to the reporters. The reporters caught the oranges, and then began to disappear. And reappear. Blinking in and out of existence, quickly at first, then slowly, then more out of existence than in, until they were all gone.

More on this story as it develops.

The City Council announced today that they just can’t be here anymore. They said this in unison, standing in a cramped meeting room, and wearing tiny rectangular sunglasses.

They added that they wish us all the best in our final weeks.

Then, they made the standard American Sign Language “I love you” gesture as smoke filled the room.

Witnesses said the smoke smelled of maple, and was a little briny, but not unpleasantly so.

When the haze cleared, the City Council was still standing in the room, apologizing, claiming, “This usually works.” And then, no longer speaking in unison, casting blame on each other for not believing hard enough, and that if it weren’t for so-and-so they’d all be on a beach somewhere safe from the bears or…whatever those things are.

When asked for an explanation about the bears…or whatever those things are, the Council simply whispered in unison, “Mistakesssss!”

No follow-up questions were asked, as reporters became physically and emotionally occupied with the dozens of agitated starlings that began pouring from the air conditioning duct.

You know, listeners, I’ve been thinking about John Peters’ orange grove. I did a little digging online and found that orange trees are not native to deserts.

I also emailed my boyfriend, Carlos, about this. He’s a scientist, which kind of makes me a scientist, too.

Here’s Carlos’ email back to me just now:

Uhmm, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, Carlos goes on about weekend bowling plans, y– you know what? You don’t need all this.

OK. I think that’s all he had about the orange trees.

I do hope we watch Liberty Valance, though. Ha! I love that film.

Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just received word that the Ralph’s is stocked full of fresh orange juice from John’s farm. It’s called J.P.’s OJ, where the O in OJ is a bright cartoonish sun with big pink eyes, and a strained toothy smile; and the J is a sickle the sun is using to slice down ripe oranges from a large tree.

Adam Bayer, weekday shift manager at the Ralph’s, said they have removed all other produce to stock J.P. Oranges, and even emptied out the refrigerators to fully showcase all of J.P.’s mouth-watering stock of fresh juice.

“Even several of the dry goods aisles had to be cleared out,” Adam said, pulling oranges from his apron pockets. He continued pulling oranges from his tiny pocket, mesmerized by their seeming infinitude, and unable to continue speaking as he began to blink out of existence.

Listeners, we here at Night Vale Community Radio need to offer the following correction:

In a previous broadcast, we described the world as “real.”

We indicated, using our voice, that it was made up of many real objects and entities, and we gave descriptions of these disparate parts. We even went so far as to ascribe action and agency to some of these entities.

But, as we all know, nothing can be fully understood to be “real.” Any description of the world we give is simply the world we experience – which is to say, a narrative we force onto whatever horror or void lies behind the scrim of our perception.

We at the station offer our deepest, most humble apologies for the previous, erroneous, report. We affirm once again that nothing is real – including this correction, and least of all, your experience of hearing it.

This has been Corrections.

More now on the orange grove.

Intern Maureen brought it to my attention that until today, John Peters – you know, the farmer? – has been missing for about four months! Former intern Dana was the last to see him. Unfortunately, we do not know where Dana was when she saw him.

We’re also unclear as to when Dana was, as time and space seem to not apply to Dana these days. She’s been without a phone charger for about eight months now, and we’re still texting. Also, I’m not sure how she’s been paying her cell phone bill.

Maureen? What is that? Maureen, that’s not a glass of orange juice you’re drinking, is it?

Oh, I see. She got it from our station break room, not from the Ralph’s, so it’s probably safe then.

Oh, well, thank you for the offer, Maureen, but I’m…still working on my coffee. [audibly sips]

Maureen? Is everything OK?

Listeners, Maureen is just…staring at me. Silent. A single bead of sweat running down her left temple. She is staring now at the orange juice. She is biting her upper lip with her lower jaw, and breathing through her nose. Her cheeks are flushing, and she is shaking her head, very…very slightly.

That looks like a “no.”

Is that a “no,” Maureen?

Listeners, I– I think that’s a “no” from Maureen.

Oh! Oh dear! Maureen just flickered. Like, she was there, and then she wasn’t, and then she was, like when a plane flies in front of the sun and the light leaves for a brief moment as you wonder – for just that split second – “Is this it? Is it over?” Only to have the sun return as your brain hears the faint hum of a distant jet and you sigh with relief and disappointment that everything is as it was. A similar thing just happened with Maureen.

Listen–

Maureen, I–

She is backing out of the studio.

She is backing out of the studio.

She has dropped the glass.

She is flickering.

She is flickering…

She is gone.

Listeners, Maureen is gone!

I hear no hum of jets, I– I see no intern, just…an open door. And an empty glass, and a spreading stain.

To the family of Intern Maureen: She was a good intern, with a beautiful puppy, and a chatty neighbor.

She will be missed.

[chime]

Wait– uhh, I just got another email from Carlos, marked URGENT. He says:

Well, now that is–

Listeners? Someone is pounding on the studio door, despite the brightly-lit ON AIR DO NOT DISTURB sign we always put out.

Dear listeners, John Peters just came to visit!

[deep breath]

I should talk with him. Maybe this is a good time for us to go to the wea–

No! Wait! Stop! John? John? No!

[“Black White and Red” by Emrys Cronin]

Listeners?

Ugh!

Listeners! What a fretful few moments we just had!

John Peters – you know, the imposter? – he burst into our studio and tried forcing me to eat an orange. I attempted to reason with him, attempted to talk about our old bowling league, and the wood shop class he used to teach, I even asked him about the hilarious times we used to have standing silent and trance-like in front of the ancient Chalk Spire – predecessor to the current Brown Stone Spire – our mouths frothing, our minds spinning, our ventricles slowing…

But John did not acknowledge any of these fond memories.

As a last resort, with the orange nearing my face and my back pressing hard against the sharp edge of my broadcast table, I grabbed my phone to tell Carlos that if I didn’t make it home tonight, it wasn’t because I didn’t love him, or didn’t want to watch a documentary on special scientific graphs, or was too obsessed with my job to relax and enjoy a good meal and some television, it was only because I was zapped out of existence by a lunatic non-John Peters.

And that, in fact, I do love Carlos, and I would want nothing more than to watch a documentary on scientific graphs over some homemade linguini, or to go out to eat again, or whatever!

But then, as I grabbed my phone, I thought, “Eh, that’s way too long to write for a text,” so…I just hit John Peters upside the head with it, knocking him unconscious.

And the Sheriff’s Secret Police came to carry the Fake John away, telling me that I didn’t see anything here…but then the StrexCorp-affiliated station management arrived, and asked the Sheriff and his Secret Police to stand down, and that they – the Secret Police – didn’t see anything here, and to move along like nothing happened. The Secret Police nodded and quietly shuffled out of the building, heads facing down at their shoes.

There’s still an empty O.J. Glass on the floor. The carpet around it is dark – not with liquid stain, but…with void.

The spilled juice has taken the rug wherever it has taken Maureen, wherever it has taken the reporters, wherever it probably took the real John Peters – you know, the farmer?

Oh. My producer, Daniel, just gave me a disapproving smile as he handed me this note:

“StrexCorp Synernists Inc., majority shareholder of J.P.’s OJ, Ltd., is recalling all oranges and juices due to…”

And here there’s just a dark red smudge across the words.

“StrexCorp apologizes for any inconveniences, disappearances, lethargy, and/or multiplicity you may have experienced.”

[chime]

Oh, Carlos texted.

And then there’s an emoji of, uh, two dinosaurs chasing an early-80s Ford Mustang up a palmetto-lined suburban street as some residents look on, shocked and scared – a few laughing – others undisturbed as they mow their lawns or sculpt their fruit-shaped topiary bushes, oh man.



Oh, that’s very cute!

Listeners, let me release my own special announcement.

Cecil Palmer would like to not be late for dinner.

Stay tuned next for an hour that will feel like minutes but will, in actuality, take weeks.

Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.
