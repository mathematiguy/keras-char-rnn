Welcome to Night Vale. 

Hello, listeners. We have some news that will affect your morning commute, so let’s dive right into it.

WALK signals across the whole of Night Vale are malfunctioning. Of course, usually they show either a graphic photo of a run-over pedestrian, indicating you should wait, or time-lapse photography of flowers wilting, indicating that it is safe to cross. But this morning, commuters all over Night Vale are reporting that, bafflingly, they now all have just the word “WALK” in bold, white letters.

Citizens are standing by the side of the road, unsure of whether they are allowed–

–unable to stop walking. WALK, the signals say. And the pedestrians walk. In unison. Arms swinging in a rigid rhythm.

This is the worst malfunctioning of WALK signals Night Vale has seen since the time all their light bulbs were accidentally replaced with poison gas dispensers.

More on this story as it looms closer to us.

And now, a word from our sponsors.

A balding grassland beneath a low cliff side.

There is a monk.

Picture what a monk looks like.

A bell rings. From his hand, maybe. Then he takes a small step. Then there’s that bell again.

It will take him a long time to make it from this bit of grass to whatever there is beyond it. An entire lifetime it will take him. And even then, he will die unfinished. Undone in midst of doing, having gone slowly to nowhere much.

Then a bell will ring. From his hand, maybe. Or from somewhere else.

And then, nothing.

Mountain Dew.

Do the Dew.

And now, back to ou–

–which I haven’t done, by the way, in years! Or, at least, days. Or at least, I’m not doing it right now!

Thursday is a lost cause, but we will keep on fighting. We will get up, say “Yes! Today is a different day than before!” believing this against all evidence, eating food like that matters. Going to jobs that mean the same thing as they did before, but cast in a new light by our own optimism, which will slowly drain away until all that is left is the movements and thoughts we’ve had before. Echoes of ourselves, underlined to emphasize the lack of emphasis.

Coming home, drifting home. Aimless homeward wandering into a kitchen that is too small for our needs, and eating food that isn’t what we imagined it would be. And watching television that means more to us than our jobs. And, finally, falling asleep – in which we dream of the Thursday that could be…if only we lived Thursday to the full potential of its Thursday-ness, not expecting it to be anything but Thursday, embracing every inch of its Thursday reality, and living each Thursday moment anew, only to wake the next Thursday, and again impose, unsuccessfully, our imagined Thursday onto the unyielding frame of Thursday. Our Thursday. A lost cause.

This has been the Community Calendar.

The crowd amassed by the WALK signals is now marching down Route 800, apparently advancing on City Hall. When reached for comment, the City Council said that they were definitely at City Hall, ready to receive the concerns of their constituents, and not, say, hiding in a hastily-dug hole in Mission Grove Park, keeping as still as possible, and breathing through their dirt gills until this all blows over.

“Incidentally,” their comment continued, “if you happen to see a conspicuous pile of earth in any parks, maybe just…throw some leaves on it, or put a bench over it, to make it less obvious. No biggie, just if you get a chance, that’d be cool,” the Council concluded, their voices noticeably muffled.

Fortunately, the effect of the WALK signals only reaches those who are looking at one, and I myself…hey, what–

How did that get in here?

Umm, listeners, there is a WALK signal in my studio. “WALK,” it says.

I must walk. The signal is saying so.

I will have to leave my desk in order to do that.

And so, before I go, I take you to the WALK-ther…the WeALtKher. The WALK. WALK. WALK. W–

And so, we are all saved again!

I’ll be honest, Night Vale, that was the most worried I’ve been in some time.

And how we were saved was so unlikely and miraculous, that I feel that today will become one of the standard tales told every year on Frightening Day.

Certainly, it is a story I will never forget.

Here is where I leave you. Not to walk away…I think I will avoid walking for a while. But certainly to go somewhere, to see someone.

And I don’t know…if he suggests a walk, I might change my mind. He can be as persuasive as hypnotic malfunctioning city equipment sometimes, as the old saying goes.

Stay tuned next for the noises of my hurried retreat, echoing first as sound, and then as memory. And maybe, then again, as part of tonight’s fractured dreaming.

Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.
