[Voice of Lauren Mallard]: Snow is falling somewhere. Many things are falling, or will fall, or have fallen, but temporary triumph is still triumph.

Welcome to the Greater Desert Bluffs Metropolitan Area. 

Hello, listeners! Another day, another broadcast, another chance to reach out and commune with you orally.

It has been a couple weeks since we began speaking to you directly, with no filters or…reinterpretation in the way, and we have forgotten all about anything any of you might have done.

StrexCorp is proud to say that we have carefully recorded, and catalogued, everything you’ve ever done, and also we’ve forgotten it all. Don’t worry about it! Let us worry about it for you. Without worry, you are free to be as efficient and productive as we all dream of being.

We all dream, every night, of our jobs, and of efficiency, and of the deep chasm of consequence and retribution if we are not as productive as we need to be. Those recurring dreams are just one of the many ways StrexCorp is happy to fill your waking hours and your timeless sleep.

Since we’ve consolidated all our community radio stations into one broadcast network, we no longer need ask why one town is doing what another isn’t. We can stop focusing on our differences, and instead focus on our similarities, our commonalities. For instance, the future! We all share that, don’t we?

Why, hello again, Kevin!

Listeners, you know Kevin! He’s a long-time host at Desert Bluffs Radio Incorporated, and a new host here on Night Vale Community Radio, where he’ll be broadcasting full-time!

Welcome, Kevin! It’s nice to finally have you here in the studio.

Hmm.

I’m happy you’re here too, Kevin. Things have been so good lately, haven’t they?

We caught the teenage felon who’s been terrorizing the town, we got our helicopters back, we brought you here, all those terrible doors that appeared a couple of weeks ago have suddenly disappeared, and no one can see the lies inside them anymore.

And your producer Daniel tells me that just a few days ago, we arrested a group of five people in lab coats who had been loitering about and trespassing on Cynthia Cabrera’s house in the Desert Creek development.

Yes! Great news! Or…almost great. There is…one scientist we expected to find there, and we did not find him. He has such perfect hair! Think of what would happen if he had agreed to add that perfect hair and those perfect teeth into our resources! It just makes you want to spit– 

I’m sorry, such a vulgar word. Let me try that again.

It just makes you want to…not smile. To not smile hard at all, when people work against productivity that way. Oh, well. We’ll find him soon enough! We find everyone we look for. We’re just fantastic at our jobs!

Oh, yay!

Wow, Kevin!

Unfortunately, it’s not all good news, Kevin.

It seems there have been some party poopers who haven’t made it to the picnic yet, or who have tried to leave early. But that’s OK! StrexCorp threw this party as a treat for their hard-working employees, and also so that they could learn who the party poopers were!

We know the party poopers now, and we’re playfully letting them know that they are party poopers. We are putting heavy stone hats on them that say “Party Pooper” until they are agreeable. It’s important to work hard, but it’s also important to play hard. But mostly, it’s important to work hard.

It sure is!

It sure is.

I couldn’t agree more! I just want to vote for both of them!

Thanks, Kev! Can I call you Kev?

Thanks, Kevin. Today’s sponsor is…oh, my! Looks like it happens to be StrexCorp!

StrexCorp. Like dew from the sky. Like a cloud that dissipates, only to come again as other clouds. Like the sun. Like a hate-filled thought that you failed to suppress. Like biting down on a fistful of sand. Like words that once held meaning. Like the sun. Like an enemy, hiding in the depths of your own body. Like the enemy that is your own body. Like a thought you wish you could have, but don’t. Like a Smiling God. Like the sun!

StrexCorp. Go to sleep.

None of us can help that! None of us have been able to for years.

And now, traffic.

[Lauren gasps with delight]

It sends a message.

I’ll miss the Seans.

And running down the walls! Yes! So much nicer!

[Deep rumbling sound like a giant dragging its prone, misshapen body across baked, waterless earth plays]

Ugh. I hate to break in there, Kevin, but we’re getting reports that there’s another fuss down at the picnic.

Yes, the Overseer is explaining to them. They’re on the ground, with their hands over their ears so that they can hear him better. Their mouths are open. No one has ever seen smiles quite like that. What an interesting way to smile! Their legs are kicking, too, like they’re still trying to dance.

You’re certainly right! There is no music at all! But, Kevin, do you know what there is?

Kevin, and all listeners out there at the company picnic, or illegally huddled in pitiful hiding spots that will be ferreted out, let’s go now to the weather.

[“Stupid” by Brendan Maclean]

…and from Lauren, here in the booth,

Today’s proverb: There’s a difference between your, you’re, and yarn. Yarn isn’t even pronounced the same way. It’s a completely different word.
