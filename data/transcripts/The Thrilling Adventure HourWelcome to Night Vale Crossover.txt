Joseph Fink: Everything that follows is not canon, except for the parts that are. 

S'tonge of the Galaxium: Oh, hi! I didn’t notice you come in! ‘Cept that I did. I notice everything. I’m an omniscient being known as S'tonge of the Galaxium. If you were omniscient, you’d know that already. But, 'cause y'aren’t omniscient, I know, because…well, I am.

I come from a race of beings powered cosmically by the force galactic. We live on the edges of what you know as reality, and what we call The Tommy Westphall Universe.

For countless eons we have observed your worlds, and have recorded their significant events. By “we,” I mean “I,” as we have transcribed the events in my great cosmic book, using our pen cosmic. And now, we shall describe for you an event so tremendous, it caused us great sadness. And great bliss. We are a complicated guy.

The event you are about to witness me witnessing is known throughout the Galaxium as Thrill Vale – Nope.

Night Adventure – Worse.

The Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover. On the nose, but works.

But first, the great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is sponsored by Patriot brand cigarettes. Patriot brand cigarettes are good for your constitution.

By WorkJuice brand coffee, the most caffeine-dense coffee legally available in this, or any, known reality.

And by your longing for universal parity, underwritten by an attempt to make sense of the senseless and random universe…or is it?

It is.

The great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is a presentation in three acts, performed in the style of radio broadcasts both old and new. There will be a brief intermission during which you might ponder your existence, and purchase malted milk balls.

The great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is appropriate for all ages, as well as for those of you who possess no age at all. It is full of sound and fury, signifying…everything.

And it begins like this:

In your future, when the universe ever-expands into the wildest west of all, outer space, where one planet is thought to be light years beyond the reach of law and order, one man brings fear to robots and aliens, and hope to the humans who long to make this frontier planet their home. He is Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars.

Sparks Nevada: I’m…from Earth.

S'tonge: He is aided in his quest by his faithful Martian companion, Croach the Tracker.

Croach: I am from G'loot Praktaw.

Sparks: Just call it– Just call it Mars.

Croach: You designate it Mars.

Sparks: Just call it Mars.

Croach: Not during the crossover.

Sparks: ♫ When there’s varmints need a-catchin’, ♫♪ and young'ns need a-savin’, ♪♫ on my rocket steed I race across the stars. ♫♪ For I’ve sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs ♪♫ to right the outlaw wrongs on Mars. ♫

All: ♪ Yes, he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars. ♪

Sparks: ♫ Oh, the hyper cattle’s hummin’, ♫♪ and the Marjun’s savage drummin’ ♪♫ are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars. ♫♪ Yo, I’m…from Earth, ♪♫ but I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars. ♫

All: ♪ Yes, he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars. ♪

Sparks: And I’m from Earth.

S'tonge: The Mars day started like you would expect, especially if you were omniscient. Then, later in the day, Sparks Nevada and Croach the Tracker had a conversation in the Marshal Station. This conversation:

Sparks: Croach, are you packing up, or…you going somewhere?

Croach: Sparks Nevada, yes. Having prepared the coffee beverage for the Marshal Station, my onus to you is complete.

Sparks: Wait, really?

Croach: I have served to relieve the onus of my people to you for the salvation of this, our planet.

Sparks: Oh, yeah, that time I saved Mars, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Croach: I have saved your life many times.

Sparks: As many as I’ve saved yours?

Croach: Yes. And I have prepared coffee very often.

Sparks: And other stuff too, yeah.

Croach: I am under onus to you for noticing.

Sparks: Yeah.

Croach: And no longer under onus to you for not acknowledging my onus.

Sparks: I said “yeah.”

Croach: Hmm. An acknowledgement of the rhythm of conversations, not onuses.

Sparks: Fair, I guess, yeah.

Croach: And now I am under onus no longer. We are, as my people designated, eve end Steve end.

Sparks: Wow, yeah. Uhh, OK, Croach.

Croach: In all of our time together, you continue to butcher my name.

Sparks: I totally do not. Croach.

Croach: Croach.

Sparks: Nnooo.

Croach: Croach.

Sparks: Nnooo.

Croach: Croach. Now, please defy your human inclination to create an emotional scene of my parting.

Sparks: Yeah, I wasn’t gonna.

Croach: Very well. Then I shall leave.

Sparks: Bye.

Croach: You are not becoming emotional?

Sparks: No. Yes, uhh…you know…bye!

Croach: Farewell, Sparks Nevada.

Sparks: Mmm-hmm.

Croach: Unless something stops me from departing…

Sparks: Um…no.

Croach: I shall depart. Now.

Sparks: OK.

Croach: From here.

Sparks: Bye.

Croach: I am departing.

Sparks: Are you, though? Because–

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Felton: Marshal! Marshal! Heeeelllllllp!

Croach: Human designated Felton, you have obstructed my exit!

Felton: Oh, sorry, Croach! Here, I’ll step aside so’s you can pass.

Croach: No no no, I shall wait for you to enter completely.

Felton: I don’t want to keep you.

Croach: There is no rush.

Sparks: All right, Croach, why don’t you stay, and hear what Felton’s hollering about?

Croach: Did the creature designated a fuzzy caterpillar traverse the surface of your arm?

Felton: No! No. One time that happened, and let’s all stop talking about it!

Croach: I shall remain. Perhaps something threatens all of G'loot Praktaw.

Sparks and Felton: That’s Mars!

Croach: Which you designate Mars.

Sparks: Mars.

Croach: And therefore threatens my tribe. If I were to save it, and them, they would be under onus to me.

Sparks: All right, well let’s find out. Let’s find out via the worst part of marshaling: talking to a civilian. Umm, what’s up, Felton? And don’t say caterpillars.

Felton: Marshal! Heeeellllllp!

Sparks: I’m right here.

Felton: I was drinking in the Space Saloon, as I am wont to do these days for reasons of melancholy and loneliness, vis-à-vis coming to terms with who I am, contrasting who I set out to be, and – don’t get me wrong, I enjoy being a rancher, hyper-cattle being good to me – but on a more personal level, I am lonely to a degree that don’t befit my person. What if it does? What does that say about my person? And there’s the…

Sparks: Felton…

Felton: type of thought circle runnin’ through my head, but space rotguts both hurt and help. Barkeep was near to cuttin’ me off at precise the number of space rotguts I asked him to. He’s a good fella, if occasionally fixated on the possibility of trouble at his place.

Sparks: Trouble at his place, yeah. Felton…

Felton: When, what should come a-bangin’ in, but trouble! Right where Barkeep didn’t want it, and where I didn’t either, pondering as I was upon matters of self and love and so-forth.

Sparks: Felton! What kind of trouble?

Felton: What kind of trouble? The worst kind! Robot outlaws! Also a human who ain’t a robot, but who is an outlaw. I runned out as soon as they started talking about gunnin’ for you, Marshal! So’s you’d have enough time to prepare yourself for their eventual arrival here! Here at…

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Claxon: Which one of you flesh and bone and blood and nerves and organs-havin’ so-and-sos is Sparks Nevady, Marshal on Mars?

Nice Man Dan: Oh, Claxon? I done told you, having tussled with Nevada before, I’ll point him out to you.

Claxon: With what? Usin’ sacks of gelatin that won’t never be 100% reliable to identify 'em in your mouth to point 'em out?

Dan: Exactly.

Samuel Bolt: Well, ha ha, don’t take no offense, Nice Man Dan. You’re nice.

Claxon:Yeah, you’re nice. We just wanna shoot somethin’!

Sparks: Well, we got some tin cans on the fence out back.

Felton: Not my can collections!

Sparks: All right.

Claxon: Being honest, sir, I prefer I shoot Sparks Nevada, the Marshal on Mars.

Sparks: You’re not gonna get that opportunity.

Samuel: You’re him? You’re Nevady?

Dan: Wait, you are?

Sparks: Yeah. We have met.

Dan: I did not recognize him! Shoulda oughta gotten my glasses prescription refilled, but I done shot my low-down cheatin’-a-punker ophthy-mologist.

Claxon: I got a good optometrist on Saturn.

Samuel: Claxon, Dan’s ophthalmologist was a medical doctor who completed college, and had at least eight years additional medical training. Whereas your Saturn optometrist ain’t nothin’ but a four year degree-havin’ nobody what can’t do much more than give vision tests.

Claxon: All’s Dan wanted was a prescription upgrade!

Dan: Well, I also got a itch in my eye wants a-proddin’ and a-pokin’ at in case it’s serious.

Sparks: I reckon I got something here pointed at you, might take care of any…problems you might have.

Dan: Is that a laser…

Sparks: It’s a laser pistol, yeah.

Dan: …pistol. I’d swear. I shoulda taken care of my eyes so they can take care of me like the poster says at my ophthalmologist’s office.

Sparks: Well, you don’t gotta take care of all your eyes, just the ones you aim to keep. My eye doctor got that poster hangin’ up. Bought it from a dentist, crossed out teeth, wrote in eyes. He’s not great at it.

Samuel: Don’t fret about it, Nice Man Dan. Claxon and I got our own guns trained on the Marshal.

Croach: Sparks Nevada, though I am no longer under onus to you, I have directed my weapon upon these outlaws, thus putting you under onus to me.

Sparks: Fine.

Felton: And I am under onus to myself, due to how I’m cowering under this d-d-d-d-d-d-desk.

Sparks: Yeah, gold star, Felton.

Nice Man Dan, last I saw you, you were headin’ up to spend time with your boy, Highwayman Dan, to set him right. What happened?

Dan: Can’t say I know exactly, Marshal. Took a wrong turn somewhere.

Felton: I don’t see how you could all make chit-chat with guns pointin’ every which way or at each other.

Sparks: The talkin’ keeps people from shootin’, usually. Go on, Dan.

Dan: Well, in the interest of fairness, we sold shoes for a piece, him investin’ his time in my interests. Then, in the spirit of further fairness, he took me robbin’ to show me his interests.

Sparks: Yeah, and let me guess: you took better to robbin’ than he did to shoes.

Dan: Hahaha…exactly. Then he met a gal…

Claxon: And she introduced him, no doubt, to unprecedented levels of adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin.

Samuel: No doubt. Hehe…humans, you know?

Croach: Oh, yes.

Felton: What happens? It happens – not to me, but to low-down highway robbers apparently.

Dan: Hey, hey, that’s my son.

Felton: Sorry, kind of.

Dan: You know, I felt like a third wheel, highway robbin’ alongside them two. Then I realized, I wasn’t robbin’ due to likin’ it, so much as to be with my son is what I liked.

Sparks: Awww.

Dan: So, uh, we parted ways in hopes that they’ll visit me sometimes on their own volition.

Samuel: Holidays and such…

Dan: That’s exactly it.

Sparks: All right, but hang on. If you quit robbin’, why are you here with outlaws and guns?

Dan: Fair question.

Sparks:Thank you.

Dan: I got one last score in me to provide the stake with which to return to the business community. Make shoes again.

Sparks: All right.

Claxon: From shoe man to robber to robbin’ to become a shoe man again. You just never know where life will take a soul.

Samuel: Robots ain’t got no souls!

Claxon: Was talkin’ about his human soul, but since you bring it up, I reckon we do, in fact.

Samuel: We don’t. End of story.

Claxon: We feel, we think, energy can neither be created nor destroyed…

Samuel: Oh, not everything is an invitation to a techno-theological conversation, Claxon!

Claxon: Some things are, though!

Sparks: I can settle it for you. I can settle it for you right now, send you to meet your maker.

Samuel: Jeremy?

Sparks: No– Jeremy? No.

Samuel: Jeremy Wadnett’s my maker.

Sparks: No, I know what– no. No. I was talking techno-theologically.

Croach: And observe how you have alienated precisely three fourths of the occupants of this room.

All: [laughter]

Samuel: A space Marjun just said 'alienate.’ What a world.

Sparks: Yeah, it’s a doozy. All right. It’s a doozy of a world. Dan, why are you robbin’ the Marshal station if you’re looking for a stake for a business? We don’t keep no cash register.

Dan: I’m a stickler for plannin’ plans! We aim to remove obstacles to our design from the large equation before we start openin’ up bank vaults and the like.

Sparks: Hmm.

Samuel: You’re that obstacle.

Sparks: Am I? Yeah, no, thanks, I got it. Yeah.

Claxon: And so’s any flesh-wrapped guts-burrito in this room with you, since they’re now privy to our plans.

Croach: Sparks Nevada, you are now under so much onus to me.

Sparks: All right, all right.

Felton: Marshal?

Sparks: What?

Felton: Heeelllllp!

Sparks: OK.

Felton: I’m under the desk!

Sparks: Yeah.

Samuel: We know you’re down there, dumdum! Want I should dispatch these two collateral damages, Dan?

Sparks: Hang on, your trigger finger moves a hair, Sam Bolt, and Croach will shut you down.

Samuel: Hair?? No thank you, but I take your meaning and I reckon I’ll aim my guns at Croach, then.

Croach: Onus!

Claxon: Looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned Venutian standoff, then, Marshal!

Sparks: Nice Man Dan, you are aware the town bank offers low interest loans, right?

Dan: Who’d grant one to a fella whose resume reads “1: shoemaker, 2: outlaw, 3: third wheel, 4: back to outlaw?”

Claxon: Don’t let your occupation define you!

Sparks: All right. Tell you what. Y'all stand down and maybe I can do somethin’ to help you.

Samuel: Us too?

Sparks: No, you two are definitely goin’ to jail.

Dan: Well, then your offer is politely rejected, Marshal. I may not have much, but I still got my words. And leavin’ these metal cattlemen to rust in jail would mean my fidelity tank is down to zero.

Claxon: Well, that’s kind of you to say, Dan.

Dan: Now let’s end this standoff, fellas. The hard way.

Sparks: All right.

Pemily Stallwark: Marshal Nevada! Come in, Sparks Nevada! It’s me, Pemily Stallwark. I am callin’ you on these here space comms.

Sparks: All right. Uh, hang on a second, Dan.

Dan: Hey, you got it.

Claxon: Us too?

Sparks: Yes, of course, you too. Yes.

Dan: Yeah, hold off.

Pemily: Claxon? Is that you?

Claxon: In the iron!

Pemily: Aww, dang it! I didn’t run you off the moon just to have you go to Mars to cause trouble for my best friend and mentor!

Claxon: Ain’t sorry.

Croach: Human designated Pemily Stallwark, I am present as well.

Pemily: Howdy, Croach.

Sparks: All right, listen, Pemily, I’m in the middle of a Venutian standoff right now–

Dan: No, go ahead and take this, we’ll be right here.

Sparks: Thanks, Nice Man Dan, that is…really nice. All right, what is on your mind, Pemily?

Pemily: Well, you know how you made me Marshal of the Moon?

Sparks: Yeah, you earned it, of course, yeah.

Pemily: Yeah. You said that if'n things ever get hairy that I should contact you. Like I’m doing now?

Sparks: Things are getting hairy down there, are they, Marshal Stallwark?

Samuel: Ugh, hair!

Sparks: All right.

Pemily: Somethin’ hairy’s happening, Marshal, but it defies description.

Sparks: Try describin’ it.

Pemily: Sensible. It’s the moon. The moon is disappearing.

Samuel: What? OK, time out from the showdown, I want to see this.

Felton: You can see the earth’s moon from here?

Samuel: Oh, you old humans got the worst possible ocular sensors, I’m telling you.

Croach: Oh, I keep telling them.

Samuel: OK.

Croach: Bagropa! The moon of the earth is disappearing!

Claxon: If'n the earth moon disappears, then the whole of the cosmos will be thrown into chaos!

Samuel: And any satellite could be next.

Claxon: Or planet, even!

Felton: [groans] You think?

Pemily: There’s hairier information to impart. I got a deputy. She’s a cyborg named Delores County, and she’s whip smart, same as I’m whip tough. We get along despite our differences, and sometimes we learn along the way that we ain’t so different.

Sparks: All right. Well, sounds great. She got a theory about how or why your moon’s disappearin’?

Pemily: Oh, more'n that. She’s pinpointed the source of the danger to thousands of years ago in the past!

Samuel: If I may…time is dangerous. Just my opinion.

Sparks: All right.

Claxon: Second!

Pemily: Deputy County rigged a mechanism whereby she can send someone to the past to stop what’s causing my moon to disappear!

Sparks: OK, well, like I said, I’ve kind of got my hands full right– ooooh, you know what? Hang on.

[Sound of laser blasters]

Claxon: Yeoow! You shot my dumb hands off!

Samuel: Hey! We’re in a time out!

Sparks: Yeah, but…

[Sound of laser blasters]

Samuel: My…my guns! You shot 'em to pieces!

Dan: I am lowering and droppin’ my gun, Marshal.

Sparks: Very good.

Dan: Well…let me tell you, cosmic little stuff is a strong argument not to shoot Marshals.

Sparks: Mmm-hmm.

Claxon: Plans go out the window for the sake of the cosmos, dude.(?)

Sparks: All right. Pemily? Now I can probably go.

Pemily: Oh, great. I’ll activate the remote temporal shift beam to your coordinates.

Sparks: All right, and I will just stand right here.

Croach: Sparks Nevada. You shot the metal enemy whose firearm was aimed at me. I am now under onus to you for saving me.

Sparks: No, great.

Croach: My final onus.

Sparks: Croach, we’ll talk about your onus when I get back, all right? For now, just…wha–?

[Sound of time travel]

Croach: Oooooonnnuuuuuuuusssssssss!

Cecil: Today you will meet a beautiful stranger. Actually, hundreds of beautiful strangers. Everyone is beautiful and you know almost none of them.

Welcome to Night Vale.

Great news, listeners! Today is the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival, sponsored by the Civic Committee for Public Holidays and Private Silent Weeping for No Reason You Can Name. All citizens are encouraged to gather in Mission Grove Park, where we will attempt to destroy the moon.

The hastily-formed Civic Committee, which just sort of popped up last Wednesday – and, like most local organizations, is anonymously managed – is also encouraging you to bring your children to the festival.

Or, if you do not have children, to bring someone else’s children.

Or, if children aren’t even real, and this existence is all a collective unconscious of incomprehensible nightmares, then just bring a canned good for $5 off your admission.

In any case, bring as many children and canned goods as possible.

“We’ll need them later,” says the Civic Committee. “Not for anything to do with the moon,” they added. “For something else. It’s a surprise. Look, forget we said anything. We just don’t want to ruin it,” the Civic Committee said from the loudspeakers recently mounted atop each of our homes. “But definitely bring those kids and canned goods,” they added, which was then followed by a maniacal laugh. “Oh, hey. This microphone is still on,” they concluded.

Listeners? We’re getting reports that there is a strange being in town. It arrived here quite suddenly, I assume, in a chariot from the sky with wheels of fire and the background hum of the cosmos taken corporeal form as its celestial force. Since I am a professional journalist, this is what I must assume. Or, maybe it just drove into town in a mid-priced sedan. There’s lots of ways to get here, and there are some ways you cannot.

This stranger is interfering with our Destroy the Moon Festival, asking us things about the moon, and our intentions for its future; asking kind of bizarre things like, “Why do you attempt to destroy the satellite designated the moon?”

Listeners, I know there are no dumb questions, just dumb realities, but even I can’t explain that one.

I’m receiving varying reports about the stranger’s appearance. It is: tall, with blue skin, bulging black eyes, and common human-like antennae. So, there are very few details that would make the stranger stand out from most people.

Either way, keep a close eye out for strangers. And if you see someone you do not know, point and shout, “Interloper!” as is our friendly Night Vale custom.

And now, let’s have a look at traffic.

Picture a dog. But with more scales, and less imbecile enthusiasm. And then some more scales. Ooh! And also a biomechanic forked tongue. Are you all picturing that?

Now, picture that dog with horns. Great and terrible horns, curving ivory spirals stained with the slow-moving prey. Here, in your mind, breathing – not the crest and trough of inhales and exhales made by plain binary lungs, but a multi-stage gasp of air. In, in, in, out. In, in, out. Not so much a breath of life, but a whispered suggestion of something much, much worse.

Picture this dog. Close your eyes, if you must, but you will see it either way. And it will see you either way.

Are you picturing the dog? You are? Good.

So, yeah. Um, maybe avoid unarmed travel on Route 800 between exits 10 and 13 today. This has been traffic.

And now, a word from our sponsors.

Today’s sponsor is, um…oh, well I’ve never actually heard of this brand, it is Patriot brand cigarettes. And of course, to represent them, popular celebrity spokes-being Deb, who is a sentient patch of haze.

Deb: Well, hello there, Cecil!

Cecil: Hi!

Deb: How are things going with the moon?

Cecil: Oh, I’m glad you asked. We have been trying and trying…

Deb: I don’t care.

Cecil: OK.

Deb: It was a rhetorical question, like “do you love me?” or “what is your social security number?”

Cecil: Ohh. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at picking up on social cues.

Deb: I am here on behalf of Patriot brand cigarettes. Listen, sure, cigarettes will give you cancer. Sure, you’ll experience pain. Sure, a lot of pain. Sure, coughing. Sure, sadness. Sure, days spent looking from a bed that you can’t leave to the neon glow of a sky that you can’t help, through a window that you can’t open. Sure. All of that, sure.

But I – I don’t actually– I don’t have a counter-point to that. It all just sounds like a bunch of human problems that don’t really affect a sentient patch of haze. So just buy some Patriot brand cigarettes. What’s the worst that could happen? I don’t care.

Cecil: Well, thank you, Deb. That sounds terrifying and deadly!

Deb: Oh, gosh, Cecil! You know how to just flatter a sentient patch of haze.

Cecil: Yeah.

Deb: Goodbye, human.

Cecil: Oh, OK.

Well, the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival has hit on a few hitches. In addition to the terrifying outsider confusing everyone with questions about why we want to destroy that hideous, mocking rock, the festival attendees have been struggling to actually destroy the moon.

They’ve been throwing things at the moon for hours now. They’ve tried common household rubbish, like coffee filters and pets, but those did very little to harm the moon. In fact, most of the objects simply arced and fell after only 20 feet or so, dropping uselessly to the earth we all know and distrust.

Some of the citizens tried throwing the kids and canned goods, but no, no no. That’s just incorrect.

“Those things are for something else,” the Civic Committee reminded. “Something that will come later.”

Save the kids and cans for that, listeners.

But beside that, it doesn’t matter what we throw, as none of it can seem to make it to even half as high as the moon, however high that thing is. “I dunno, sixty feet? At least?” say reputable and very cute scientists, whose turn it is to call me tonight, about…you know, seven, or six, yeah…anyway, scientists agree that the whole “throwing things” plan is just not working. Actually, you know what? Call me at six. Carlos? Call me at six. Cool.

Um, I have invited my friend, former intern and current all-powerful Night Vale mayor, Dana Cardinal, into the studio. Um, she’s been out at the festival all day.

So, Dana, tell us what’s been happening?

Dana: Thanks, Cecil. As you know, the Destroy the Moon Festival started slowly, but we should not worry. I talked to the Civic Committee, and throwing things was just the first plan. There are many others. The next plan is that we all should direct hurtful remarks at the moon. Don’t hold back. Here, I’ll demonstrate.

[Clears throat]

Hey moon! Your glow is the death rattle to the breaking light of day! You symbolize all that is meek and obscured and radiant with shame. And also, you’re just a big old dumbo on top of all that, you stupid piece of rock that couldn’t even escape orbit and float away forever into the forever away.

Do you want to give it a try?

Cecil: Oh, umm, OK.

[Clears throat]

I do not understand you or your history, and so I fear and detest you!

Dana: Good! That was very good, Cecil.

Cecil: Thank you.

Dana: I really want to get the word out to everyone going to the festival today to be prepared to cast great insults at that ridiculous gray circle. Or half-circle. Or crescent shape or…whatever it is. Ugh! It’s always changing! It’s like, make up your mind, idiot!

Cecil: Right? Totally!

OK, listeners, um, you heard Dana, let’s all practice. What I want you to do is imagine the moon is above you. Just imagine me holding up my hand right now. And now, imagine that my hand is the moon. And I want you to fill your lungs with air, the air that you take for granted, and shout an insult at the moon. Let’s say, “I hate you, moon!”

Crowd: I hate you, moon!

Cecil: Great, now do it louder.

Crowd: I hate you, moon!

Cecil: Even louder!

Crowd: I hate you, moon!

Cecil: OK, that was great! Yeah!

So, um, now imagine that my hand is down (which it is), and when you’re in Mission Grove Park, that is what you should do. We are going to vanquish this foolish nocturnal glow orb once and for all.

And while you silently continue to practice your shouting, I take you now to the weather.

Steve Carlsberg: Excuse me! Cecil! Wait, stay where you are! Please!

Cecil: No! No, no, no, no, no!

Steve: Oh, yeah.

Cecil: Do not come into my radio studio and interrupt important weather updates, Steve Carlsberg! You have destroyed the sanctity of my working environment.

Steve: OK. Look, Cecil, I’ve been watching what’s happening with the Destroy the Moon festival, and I found out some things. Important things. Things that may be of interest to your listeners.

Cecil: Dana, does it smell weird in here? It kind of smells weird, right?

Steve: Look, contrary to what our science teachers have told us, Night Vale, the moon is a real thing. It is not 60 feet off the ground, but hundreds of thousands of miles away from us!

Cecil: [Laughing] Oh, no you…

Steve: In space!

Cecil: I…I can’t. [Cecil snorts]

Steve: Yes! Yes! In fact, American astronauts have visited the moon several times!

Look, look. I know most scientists will tell you that the moon is a universally shared dream. Scientists have long said that there’s not really a moon there, and that no one is actually seeing a moon, but we all pretend that we do, because we are told from an early age that it is there.

Astronomers believe the moon to be part of a cultural narrative, and…and if we stop believing there was a moon, it simply would no longer be there, not unlike what happened to the dinosaurs. But I found this heavily-charred, yet still-legible book.

Dana: Steve? I think that book was supposed to be destroyed in last week’s bimonthly library cleanse. I don’t know if that’s safe to read.

Steve: You’re right, Dana, which is why I avoided reading most of it. Also, because I don’t like looking directly at words. But this one last part? It stood out. Look here. Read this last line of the final chapter.

Dana: “So, in conclusion, the moon is totally real. You’d better believe it.”

And then there’s a winking smiley face with two finger guns on either side. Wow, Cecil, Steve may be onto something. This looks like real science!

Carlos: 'Scuse me, I might be able to help better determine what is and isn’t science, OK? Like, for instance, minivans? Science. Horses? Pure fiction.

Cecil: Carlos! What are you doing here? No, wait…did you find your way back from that other desert world already?

Carlos: No, I’m just projecting myself here. It’s actually a trick that Dana taught me. I can’t do it for long, or physically interact with anything, though.

Cecil: Aww.

Cecil and Carlos: Dang.

Dana: Right?

Carlos: I felt that something very unusual and dangerous is about to happen, and I knew that Night Vale would need someone who knew what is and isn’t science.

Steve: But it’s…all due respect, but it’s in the book!

Cecil: Anyone can write a book, Steve. It doesn’t mean that it’s true. Have you ever read A Hundred Years of Solitude? Not a single true thing in that book. Entirely made up. People are all like, “This book is so good, like, such a classic of postmodern literature,” but it’s entirely lies! This is the problem with books, Steve! Lies!

Croach: The book is correct.

Cecil, Dana, and Steve: Interloper!

Carlos: Oh, uh, right. Interloper!

Cecil: No, Did you not see the ON AIR sign outside the door?

Croach: I detected no such sign with any of my myriad senses.

Steve: Yeah, me neither, with my seven of them.

Dana: Me neither.

Cecil: Well, I wrote right here on my to do list, um, “Put ON THE AIR sign above studio door.”

Carlos: Cecil, is there a line through that item?

Cecil: Noooo…

Carlos: What about a check mark?

Cecil: Uh, noooo…and I don’t understand what you’re getting at.

Croach: Humans! I have come here to…to, uh…

Steve: Night Vale?

Croach: Night Vale…

Carlos: Uh, sorry, no, it’s Night Vale.

Croach: That is what I said, Night Vale.

Dana: Night Vale.

Croach: Please cease attempting to destroy the satellite designated the earth’s moon, denizens of Night Vale.

Cecil, Carlos, Steve, and Dana: Night Vale!

Croach: Do you not know what the destruction of your single moon would do to your planet?

Cecil: Pshh! Most likely nothing!

Dana: Maybe even good things.

Carlos: I know exactly what it would do, thank you very much. I mean, what is science but an exact knowledge of what the future holds, OK?

Croach: Bagropa! Human, your teeth and hair are the finest teeth and hair I have ever encountered! No. No, second-finest. No, finest. First. No, you– you know, top two.

Cecil: Yeah. Yeah. Right?

Steve: Look, everybody, I’d listen to this guy! He seems to understand things about space. He looks like a person that…

Croach: Mmm. Not a person.

Steve: OK, like a guy, then, who…

Croach: No.

Steve: Like a sentient entity that understands the careful balance of the cosmos. Where are you from, anyway, stranger?

Croach: I am from G'loot Praktaw.

Dana: I don’t know what that is.

Croach: You designate it Mars.

Cecil: Nope, still does not ring a bell.

Steve: Never heard of it.

Carlos: I am a scientist and so I, of course, know exactly whatever that place he said was, so…

Dana: Yeah, don’t know it.

Croach: I have come from Mars, and the future, to this time and place to relieve my onus and to save the moon of this planet. Who is this Civic Committee that has been planning to destroy your moon?

Cecil: Nobody knows.

Dana: Oh, I do.

Cecil: Oh.

Dana: I met them yesterday, a couple of really nice robots.

Carlos: Robots? That is exciting!

Croach: You possess robots in this place, in this time?

Dana: Yeah, made of metal. Inexplicably filled with life and aimless sentience, like everybody else. Robots. Oh, they’re right over there!

Claxon: That’s right, blue skin! We are still in the future, standing with your endocrine system-having pal back on your red planet and we are also here in the past, fixin’ to bring down the moon.

Samuel: Yeah, we don’t care about no moon!

Claxon: Nope! I shot a moon of Pluto just to watch it die.

Samuel: Folks are always excited about their moon, writin’ poetry and understandin’ the tides and paintin’ pictures of a waning gibbous pseudo orb gently lighting a soft silver forest lining a crystalline lake as a family of deer peer out from the shadows of winter trees.

Claxon: Yeah. And always goin’ on about the way the clouds seem like a reflection of the moonlight, which is a reflection of the sunlight, which is a reflection of a history so distant it wisps away like clouds.

Samuel: We do not like it.

Dana: Wait, what did you need with the kids and canned goods?

Samuel: Oh, we set up a kids craft fair near the festival and started a canned food drive for the needy.

Claxon: There’s also a bounce house.

Samuel: Ooh, yeah, right, there’s a bounce house too.

Claxon: Should be fun for them and…and support a real good cause.

Samuel: Adios!

Cecil: Oh…OK.

Carlos: My detector’s telling me that those scientifically fascinating robots have left through time using a remote temporal shift beam. Just so you know.

Croach: Without direct communication with the human Marshal designated Pemily Stallwark across time and space, I have no way to follow them.

Cecil: No, wait, we have a radio tower. And that is for communicating.

Dana: Or you could just use my temporal shift beam.

Croach: You possess your own temporal shift beam?

Dana: Um, everyone does. The City Council decriminalized time travel months ago.

Croach: Then I shall pursue them. Oh, it is your device. Do you wish to come? I do not care to be under onus to a past being.

Dana: I’ve spent enough time moving weirdly through time and space. It was so-so. Not really my thing, so you boys go on ahead.

Cecil: You know what? I’ll join you. I’ve always wanted to know if the future was real, or an elaborate urban legend.

Dana: Here, let me Just find my temporal shift beam. It’s somewhere in my bag, just…

Cecil: Listeners? Stay tuned next for a digital sound effect, an empty stage, and several minutes of people moving about the theater to buy drinks and chat and use restrooms.

And, as always: goodnight, Night Vale.

Croach: Night Vale.

Steve: Incorrect.

Dana: Oh, I found it!

Cecil: Goodnight.

[Beep]

Joseph Fink: End of Side A. Please turn to Side B.

Cecil: Ladies and gentlemen, and all betwixt, between, and beyond: we were so rudely interrupted by a disgrace to our decent…

Steve: Hi, everyone!

Cecil: Yes, him. We were interrupted before we could give you some important climate information, so…

Steve: Yeah, I’m real sorry about that, Cecil.

Cecil: Oh my goodness.

Steve: I just…I had some important information to convey!

Cecil: So, I take you all…

Steve: I think it turned out OK, though. I mean, I said the information, and now that the whole moon business is really starting to heat up…

Cecil: Yes.

Steve: You know, uh…

Cecil: As I was saying, listeners of every kind, I take you now…

Steve: Oh-ho, this is my favorite part!

Cecil: Steven Eugene Carlsberg! Please!

I take you now to…

Steve: Oh-ho-ho boy, I can’t wait!

Cecil: You know what? That’s it. Forget it. There’s no actual weather report for today. So…let’s just jump right…

Steve: No no no no no no no no, wait! I have a weather report!

[Clears throat]

♫ Who’s that? Flyin’ at the speed of light? ♫ ♪ Who’s that? Full of might and out of sight? ♪♫ When Apex City’s cursed by crime, ♫

Cecil: OK. No you…

♪ He’s on the scene in laser time! ♪

Cecil: No, no, no, no, no, no. We– we’re done here.

Steve: Okey doke. See ya! Hahahaha!

Cecil: And now, a word from our sponsors. Today’s sponsor is WorkJuice brand coffee.

Now, for some reason, they sent us a script that was completely inappropriate for use in advertising, like…you should have seen this thing, it was bizarre! Honestly, I have never seen an ad quite like it. It was really…gross, and it talked about things like what the product does, and how to buy it.

So I did them the favor of rewriting that obvious mistaken release and now it is a very effective ad, if I do say so myself.

That preface aside, let’s hear from WorkJuice.

Ad-Man 1: It’s an updated script. What is this? It’s covered in…is this tar?

Ad-Man 2: We’re on!

Ad-Man 1: Boy, I’m tired after this long work day. If only there was some way of feeling more aware! More awake!

Ad-Man 2: Well, have you tried…I can barely read this!

Ad-Man 1: More awake! More of a human! More…me! Or…more mes. If the whole world was me, and we had no need to communicate, or fight, or work, or do anything but stand there and know what all the rest of us were thinking, because…we would all be thinking those things at the same time.

Ad-Man 2: My fingers are burning!

Ad-Man 1: Every once in a while one of us would smile in acknowledgement of what we were thinking, but only one of us. The rest of us would not need to smile, because that one single one of us would have done it for the rest of us. So we would all know that, and do nothing.

Ad-Man 2: Does this even mention WorkJuice Coffee? You should drink WorkJuice Coffee!

Ad-Man 1: That is mostly what we would do! Knowing and nothing, knowing and…nothing. And we would age, grow, and gray at the exact same rate and to the exact same height. And then, one day, we would all be gone. All at once. And no one would have to be sad, or miss anyone.

Ad-Man 2: I can’t move my arms. I can’t feel my body! What is on this script?

Will you touch me? Touch me, just…to let me know I am real?

Ad-Man 1: Yes.

WorkJuice brand coffee! Because we will, all of us, die together in one glorious moment.

Ad-Man 2: My fingers! Where are my fingers? My…knees!

S'tonge: It’s me! S'tonge of the Galaxium! As an all-seeing cosmic entity, it’s my blessing and curse to alone watch the universe – even the boring stuff – but not to do anything about it. Like, I can’t create a mate out of nothing but space powers and loneliness to watch the universe with and talk to about what’s happening out there. Nope! Because she will eventually leave when she discovers what I did.

“Maybe she wouldn’t leave,” I know, “thanks to omniscience,” you may be saying.

Well, you just proved y'all don’t have omniscience. She would leave.

When we last left our heroes, Earth’s moon was disappearing. Two of Sparks Nevada’s robot rogues were maybe to blame, and Croach the Tracker traveled through time and space to the root of the problem, the desert town of Night Vale.

We now bring you Act 3 of the Great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover, precisely where we left our Marshal, in the Marshal’s Station.

Sparks: …talk about your onus, when I get back, Croach, but for now…

Croach: Sparks Nevada, I have returned.

Sparks: From where?

Croach: From the past.

Sparks: You…moved?

Pemily: Uh-huh. My deputy’s chronal shifts are precise. Croach? Marshal Nevada didn’t even know you was gone!

Sparks: Did you pay extra for that?

Pemily: …Little bit.

Sparks: Little bit, yeah.

Croach: I did not return under the power of the chronal shift of the deputy of the Marshal of the moon of the earth. I returned under the power of…bagropa! Where are the humans who accompanied me from the past?

Sparks: Wait, you brought folk back with you? Didn’t you read the Handbook of USSA Time Travel Standards, Updated Edition?

Croach: I disagreed strongly with the tone taken in the foreword.

Sparks: You can’t…ugh, Croach.

Felton: Marshal! Heeellllp! Croach done caused a temporal paradox!

Croach: I did not!

Felton: You maybe did!

Croach: I did not! Unless the denizens of Night Vale stopped to attempt to introduce the weather and initiate an advertisement in the middle of transport, thus losing them in time, in which case they caused at least one paradox.

[Sound of materialization]

And now they have un-caused it.

Cecil: Um, it’s pronounced Night Vale.

Croach: Night Vale.

Sparks: Yeah, that’s what he said, Night Vale.

Cecil: No, no, Night Vale. Like, use your mouth.

Sparks: Use my mouth? I’m us– OK. Night Vale.

Carlos: Night Vale.

Croach: Night Vale.

Sparks: Night Vale.

Croach: Night Vale.

Sparks: Night –

Croach: Do not even bother, Sparks Nevada.

Felton: Are you…from the past?

Carlos: Yeah! Doesn’t everything originate from the past?

Felton: Can you reveal elements of the past?

Cecil: I suppose.

Felton: What’s gonna have happened to me?

Sparks: You know…that’s not how it…all right…never mind, Felton.

All right, I’m Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars. I’m……from Earth.

Steve: Same. Steve. Carlsberg.

Sparks: No.

Steve: With an E.

Felton: With an E? J– Just one?

Steve: What?

Felton: What?

Steve: What?

Felton: What?

Steve: Whats?

Felton: What whats?

Steve: What? What what? What?

Felton: I already do not like this guy.

Sparks: All right, let’s not…

Carlos: Uh, if I may, I’m Carlos. I’m a scientist.

Sparks: Oh, a scientist. What, uh, what kind?

Carlos: I, uh, I’m sorry, I don’t understand?

Sparks: Well, there are all kinds of…like, what sort of area…uh, we get a lot of mad scie– uh, like, what’s your field of study, I guess?

Carlos: Uhh, science.

Sparks: Okey doke. And you?

Cecil: Um, I’m Cecil Palmer, I’m the host of Night Vale Community Radio.

Sparks: Yeah…Yeah, I don’t know what that is. Anyway, welcome to Mars.

Cecil: Yeah, I don’t know what that is.

Sparks: You don’t know what Mars is?

Carlos: Uh, I know exactly what it is. Yeah, I’ve, um, I’ve written papers.

Sparks: All right.

Carlos: Um, not about, uh, whatever this place is…

Sparks: Mars.

Carlos: …specifically, yeah, but…you know, still. Papers. About things.

Sparks: OK, but you know it’s a place.

Claxon: It’s a planet, you ignoramuses!

Cecil: No, my very efficient City Council gave us nine prophecies…nope. I don’t…I don’t know what it is.

Samuel: Well, it ain’t not one, that’s for sure.

Dan: Well, he ain’t wrong.

Howdy! Nice Man Dan.

Cecil: Ohh! You seem nice!

Sparks: Yeah, listen you…you all seem nice, all right? Cecil seems really nice here, but…you understand, I can’t allow you to be in our time. You’ve likely got past germs all over you, stuff we eradicated generations ago, like, uh, I don’t know, help me out.

Dan: Sinus infections…

Sparks: Si– yes, sure.

Cecil: Um, I’m battling Lyme disease.

Sparks: What is that?

Dan: You know Space Lyme disease?

Sparks: Sure.

Dan: Lyme disease is the past version of it. I’m a history buff.

Sparks: Oh.

Carlos: Of diseases exclusively?

Dan: And maladies. I made a diorama I called Germs: Then and Now. If anyone wants to see a diorama.

Steve: All right, just…hold up, all right? Now, how do we know that you guys don’t all have future germs? You know, like, stuff we don’t even know about? Little robots the size of your cells, that flow through your blood stream like teeny tiny construction workers…itus? That’s probably what they call it? I bet?

Croach: It is designated Nah Nohtek, and it exists within all of the glorious people, and it is glorious.

Steve: I was right?

Cecil: Yes, shut up, Steve Carlsberg. Nobody asked you, and nobody ever will.

Croach: I possess no affection for the human designated Steve Carlsberg.

Steve: I can hear you…

Cecil: Yes!

Steve: …buddy!

Croach: I am not your buddy.

Pemily: Hey, hey, everyone? Moon’s still disappearing. Catastrophe ain’t averted!

Cecil: Oh, my gosh. This is embarrassing.

Steve: It’s not our fault.

Croach: It is somewhat your fault.

Carlos: Mostly it’s the scientifically fascinating robot’s fault!

Samuel: Are you pointin’ keratin fingernails and their friends fingers at us, intimatin’ we’re disappearing the moon, while simultaneously rubbin’ in the fact that I ain’t got no fingers’ pal’s hands, due to the Marshal shootin’ 'em off me?

Pemily: If it’s their fault, reckon I know who to shake until they stop wreckin’ my moon!

Sparks: All right, no no no no. I’m handling this, Marshal.

Pemily: My moon’s in peril, Marshal!

Sparks: And I’m taking care of it, Marshal.

Pemily: Not yet you’re not! We’re streaming ourselves over, Marshal!

Sparks: No, don’t come here! It’s gonna be too crowded…

Pemily: Initiate a stream, Deputy County!

[Sound of materialization]

Delores County: Howdy, everyone. Deputy Delores County.

Sparks: Howdy.

Delores: I am a cyborg, howdy. Deputy Delores County, from the moon, howdy.

Claxon: Pleasure.

Samuel: Pleasure.

Croach: Howdy.

Delores: Deputy Delores County, hello. Nice to meet you. Deputy Delores County, cyborg from the moon…

[everyone calling out greetings]

Delores: Delores County, moon.

Pemily: Yeah, they got it. All right.

Whoo! It’s crowded in here, Marshal! Our Marshal Station on the moon is, uh, way roomier.

Sparks: Yeah, well you ain’t probably got Martians, local folk, robot outlaws, time travelers, cyborgs, and Moon Marshals crowdin’ it up.

Pemily: Uh-huh. Uh, yeah, we got one fewer, one fewer, uh, three fewer, two fewer, and…same, and same. Round thereabouts.

Sparks: Yeah.

Dan: Tell you what, it is feelin’ crowded, and I can’t see what I’m adding to this situation, nor what Felton adds…

Felton: Hey!

Dan: So, uh, well, what say I take him for a drink at the saloon? That’d be two of us out of your hair.

Sparks: Oh, I cannot stay mad at you, Nice Man Dan!

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Sparks: All right, now Dr. Carlos is saying it’s these robots to blame for the earth moon falling apart, right?

Cecil: Well, you see, in Night Vale, a Civic Committee for Public Holidays and Private Silent Weeping for No Reason You Can Name was formed, and they sponsored the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival.

Sparks: Destroy the moon? What, with like, bombs?

Cecil: Nooo…

Sparks: A really big…really big gun?

Carlos: Uh, eh…not exactly.

Sparks: A bunch of…really small guns? How’re we doin’ this?

Cecil: Um, well? We threw things at it.

Pemily: Huh. I’m from the moon, fella, and I don’t think that could destroy it.

Cecil: Ooh! Uh, we also called it names.

Steve: And…and we generally insulted it.

Cecil: Mmm-hmm.

Pemily: That ain’t gonna destroy my moon neither.

Sparks: And that don’t explain why we hold these two responsible.

Claxon: With your fingers! Insult to injury.

Cecil: Well, these two robots were the aforementioned Civic Committee.

Sparks: Wait a sec. How is that even possible?

Samuel: That ain’t possible!

Carlos: Everything ain’t ain’t possible always. Possibility is manifest in every corner of the void of our reality.

Claxon: I ain’t in the past! I’m here. Where I am.

Samuel: Yeah, me too! Maybe even more'n him! We don’t even have the means to time travel, let alone knowin’ what to do when we get there.

Carlos: I mean, you could have stolen someone else’s personal temporal shift beam generators.

Cecil: Yeah, sure, they’re everywhere. I mean, I’ve got one here in my fanny pack.

Delores: Now what’s that, an external fanny pack?

Cecil: Wait…you have an internal one?

Delores: Yeah. Cyborg…so, uh…

Cecil: Oh. That must be nice.

Delores: Hey, yours is nice, too. Probably easier to access, and colorful. I like it.

Cecil: Thank you.

Carlos: I tell him he looks like a baby boomer mom out on a cruise vacation.

Croach: All right.

Pemily: If you say so.

Delores: Whatever rocks your boat.

Sparks: I don’t know, cadence and all, it sounds like a contemporary reference. It is lost on us.

Claxon: Well, the fact it’s on the outside of you, just danglin’ a temporal shift generator in there means it is ripe for the stealin’.

[Brief sound of a struggle]

Or would be, for somebody with the hands to do it.

Sparks: Yeah, you don’t have any.

Samuel: I got hands. Watch!

[Briefer sound of a fanny pack unclipping]

Cecil: No! My fanny pack!

[Unzipping sound]

Samuel: Here we go!

[Sound of materialization]

Sparks: What…happened?

Pemily: They’re still here.

Samuel: Uh, we ain’t. We’re back.

Claxon: Ain’t never thought settin’ up a Civic Committee could be such a laugh! Remember that one fella?

“Ooh, my name is Hiram McDaniels! Ooh, I’m a five-headed dragon and I’ve got plans for Night Vale too! Heh-heh-heh!”

Cecil: You know, that’s exactly what he sounds like.

Samuel: We didn’t let him join, for obvious reasons.

Claxon: That one head.

Samuel: Ugh. So we all was right. We set in motion events to disappear the moon. And that ain’t all.

Claxon: Bye-bye, Marshal!

Sparks: Bye-bye Mar– me?

Claxon: No!

Pemily: Hey! Hey, I’m…I’m disappearing!

Delores: Marshal Stallwark!

Pemily: Wh– what’s happening to me?

Claxon: Oh, we made some adjustments to the timeline. Capriciously, I admit, but, uh, we just wanted to see if'n they’d take.

Samuel: We fixed it so’s you’re no longer the winner of the lottery-filled bloodsport in which you made your name: beating the caste system by being the last kid standing in a lethal game of intramural soccer.

Pemily: But…but if'n I didn’t win the punishment soccer, then that means I…I lost. I died.

Claxon: Bye, little human with girl chromosomes!

Pemily: Now I remember. Lucky side tackle Jessica! [Coughs] Nice having known you, Nevada. Croach. Only I…I didn’t.

[Pemily fades in a sound of chimes]

Sparks: All right, you two are super under arrest. Time crimes ain’t misdemeanors.

Cecil: Actually, in Night Vale, they’ve been downgraded to infractions.

Sparks: Infractions?

Cecil: They were barely worth the citation for most meter readers.

[Sound of materialization]

Sparks: Ohh!

Samuel: And we’re back!

Sparks: Now what?

Claxon: See how I’m wavin’ at you, Nevady?

Sparks: Yeah.

Claxon: I got my hands back!

Samuel: Yeah, hey! Hey! [laughs] I got one. We should, uh, [whispers]…

Claxon: Oh! Good one!

[Sound of materialization]

Samuel: [Maniacal laughter]

Cecil: Oh my!

Sparks: Oh no! What’s the matter, did they kill you too?

Cecil: No, I– I– I– I don’t know how to bowl anymore! And I don’t even know what bowling is!

You monsters!

Claxon: Sam Bolt? What you want to do to Nevady?

Sparks: All right, not so fast. Citizens of Night Vale have temporal shift generators, right?

Cecil: Um, Night Vale. And yes.

Sparks: All right. Give me yours, Steve Carlsberg.

Steve: Uh, I…I can’t.

Cecil: Give it to him, Steve Carlsberg!

Steve: No, no no, I– I want to, but I always misplace it, so I left it at home for safe keeping.

All: Oh, Steve Carlsberg!

Sparks: Carlsberg!

Delores: Enough! All right, I am still here, and without Marshal Stallwark having lived to be my boss, I am an ornery cuss.

Sparks: And why is that?

Delores: You want me to explain the particulars of the space time continuity, or you want me to show you what it means?

Sparks: Uhhhhhhhhhh….honestly?

Delores: Suffice it to say, Chicky Sulliman won a real big star war, and he’s currently emperor of the universe, and I expect the only reason you ain’t a cyborg right now is he likes you.

Sparks: Yeah, OK, one thing at a time.

Claxon: Space time continuity makes my head hurt.

Samuel: Yeah. I don’t even know what y'all are talking about, and I ain’t interested in learning about it nor discussin’ it any further.

Reckon I only aim to shoot this deputy for confusing everything somethin’ powerful.

Delores: Go ahead and try.

Samuel: My guns! Where’d they get to?

Delores: Oh, they got to me destroyin’ them. I got my own time travel tech can’t be stolen nor destroyed, seein’ it’s part of me.

Claxon: We didn’t even hear you shift!

Delores: Had it set to silent.

Sparks: Silent.

Delores: You see, without balance brought by the things that were, I shifted forward in time a ways to upgrade my intelligence and system ops.

Sparks: Oh, I don’t understand what one thing has to do with the other.

Delores: You wouldn’t.

Sparks: Mean.

Carlos: Um, if I may, I think it’s about balance out of balance, going to…you know, she who seeks balance for herself.

Delores: That’s exactly right! Sometimes it takes a past man to tell a future man the present.

Cecil: I couldn’t have said it better myself! And if I could have, I wouldn’t have, because it would have been illegal to do so.

Sparks: What?

Samuel: Well, I aim to shift to before you did it and…[grunts] why ain’t my shifter workin’?

Delores: Bustin’ up your guns and time shifter ain’t all I did.

Cecil: Hey! Bowling! Yes! I remember it, and I love it!

[Piano plays as Pemily returns]

Pemily: There was…darkness. Nothin’. And…numbers. I remember an endless stream of random numbers.

♫ I am a…champion, ♫♪ and…you’re gonna hear me roar! ♪

Sparks: All right, Marshal Stallwark. Let’s shut these robots down, permanently.

Delores: Not yet, Marshal.

Sparks: What?

Delores: We destroy them now, and the moon’ll just keep on disappearin’. They ain’t who caused its destruction. Nor is it the people of Night Vale.

Cecil: Are you sure? Because our insults were very cutting.

Sparks: All right, what is it, Deputy? What’s causing the moon to disappear?

Delores: Well, me. Paradox due to undoin’ what I undone but still have the upgrades caused by the undone things havin’ been done. [Coughs]

Uh-oh. Ugh. Now that the balance is being restored, I’m becoming the fulcrum of the paradox. Along with the moon.

Cecil: Two fulcrums?

Delores: Because I’m from the moon.

Cecil: I don’t understand.

Carlos: That has the shape and sound of science, I am sure it all makes sense and anyone listening would recognize it as a completely logical explanation.

Felton: Marshal! Marshal! Heeelllp!

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Felton: Nice Man Dan and I were over drinkin’ at the space saloon. An alarm went off due to the situation on Earth’s moon, causing a galaxy-wide domino effect! Not nearly as fun as an actual game of dominoes! But very far! Throughout the galaxy! Balance [audience member sneezes] and…Bless you! And…Balance and order are canceled!

Dan: Looks like the end times. Gotta say, when I thought of dyin’, I always knew it’d be something like this.

Cecil: You always knew it would be due to Earth’s moon disappearing and causing intergalactic turmoil?

Dan: Yup.

Cecil: Me too!

Sparks: Well, I guess if'n this is really the end, then…I’m glad to be surrounded by all y'all. 'Cept you two.

Steve: Oh, come on, we just met!

Sparks: I was talking about the robots, but yeah, you three.

Carlos: Hey, uh, Cecil? If this is the last conversation we have, then let’s just…not have it. I mean, let’s just remember every conversation we’ve had in our lives, going back.

Cecil: I remember every one.

Croach: Sparks Nevada, it pains me that I shall perish while still under onus to you.

Sparks: Consider it a wash.

Croach: I cannot. That is not how onus works.

Sparks: Croach? Your onus to me would be fulfilled if you’d agree that servin’ together had been one adventure after another.

Croach: I agree to that.

Sparks: And, you’ve been, and…well, you’ve been and are my…just my total…my…my best…ffffff…you are my…best fff…

Croach: Your best what, Sparks Nevada?

Sparks: I’m doing it. I’m doing it. Umm. You are…my…

Steve: You’re my best friend, Cecil!

Sparks: What?

Cecil: Wait, me? Really?

Carlos: Him?

Steve: Well…well, yeah.

Cecil: I– Oh! I…

Sparks: All right. No no no, Croach, it’s just that…that is to say, Croach, you are…you are my best…

Croach: What are you expressing, Sparks Nevada?

Pemily: Deputy, you’re my best friend!

Delores: Oh, and you’re mine too, Pem!

Sparks: No, hang on!

Pemily: I love you!

Delores: I love you!

Sparks: OK, let’s not…OK. Croach, I just…

Croach: Sparks Nevada. I possess a single emotion. And it is known as…

[Sound of materialization]

S'tonge: Hello! I am S'tonge. Of the Galaxium?

Sparks: Oh, thank goodness.

S'tonge: I’ve been watching what’s been happening with this great crossover, and I can’t just watch any longer.

Cecil: You’ve just been hanging out, watching our world about to end?

S'tonge: I am of the Galaxium. We’re a timeless, and comics – cosmically-powered race. Comically, too. Cosmically comically-powered race. We are forbidden to interfere with the events of the universe.

Sparks: Yeah, well, I un-forbid you. It totally ain’t against the law.

S'tonge: No, I know, it’s more of an infraction.

Sparks: Infraction?

Pemily: Oh, I’m feelin’ a whole lot of bloodlust towards this guy. Think I’m gonna shoot him.

Delores: Don’t! I…I know S'tonge of the Galaxium due to all my upgrades that are killing me, the moon, and everything.

S'tonge, you have the force galactic, the cosmic energies that make up the makeup of everything.

S'tonge: Yup. But I am unallowed to use them. As I said. Apparently I’m allowed to repeat myself.

Delores: But…you could do it, couldn’t you? You could defy your…what, law?

S'tonge: More of a local ordinance.

Sparks: All right, well, then do it. Yeah, do it. Defy the heck out of it, I’ll take what comes.

S'tonge: I don’t know…

Cecil: Um, S'tonge, is it?

S'tonge: S'tonge? You pronounced my name correctly!

Cecil: Yes. S'tonge, now, if you can help us, do! We need you to. We humans and…

Croach: [Clears throat] I have simulated the clearing of the single human esophageal tract to draw attention to the fact that I am not human.

Samuel: Uh, us neither.

Cecil: Uh, of course. Um, beings, then. We beings really like…well, being. Um, it– it’s right in the name.

Pemily: I’ve tasted enough death today, let alone in my life. I don’t welcome no more.

Steve: Yeah, without living, there’d be no friendship.

Carlos: No love.

Cecil: No bowling.

Sparks: No paperwork.

Croach: No Sparks Nevada.

Sparks: What?

S'tonge: You beings, I am moved. It’s been a long time since I’ve been moved.

Felton: So you’ll do it? You’ll help us?

S'tonge: I am moved by Sparks Nevada’s bravery.

Sparks: You…are welcome.

S'tonge: By Cecil Gershwin Palmer’s heart.

Cecil: Thank you, and there is quite a bit of blood in it…um, more than I am comfortable admitting.

Sparks: I also got heart, so…

S'tonge: Not as much.

Sparks: Definitely as much.

S'tonge: More bravery. Definitely more bravery than heart.

Sparks: Disagree.

S'tonge: I’m moved by the tenacity of Pemily Stallwark, by the science of Carlos the Scientist. By the skepticism of Steve Carlsberg. By the nice of Nice Man Dan.

Dan: You ain’t so bad yourself.

S'tonge: By your healthy fear, Felton.

Felton: Thanks.

S'tonge: And by the funny orneriness of this one robot.

Claxon: D'aww, shut up.

S'tonge: By the fact that this other one is a really good drummer.

Claxon: You are? I didn’t know!

Samuel: Well…y– you never asked.

S'tonge: By your beauty, Delores County.

Delores: Beauty? Really?

S'tonge: You may be the most beautiful creature in the galaxy.

Delores: Ugh. Yeah, I mean, thanks, I guess. Heap of other qualities by which I choose to define myself, but, uh, you choose my looks. That’s…tellin’.

S'tonge: It is my desire that you become my cosmic bride.

Delores: This is sudden.

S'tonge: Not to me.

Sparks: It is, uh…it is pretty sudden.

Delores: S'tonge, if I decline…

S'tonge: I definitely won’t save your universe.

All: [general groans of protest mixed with encouraging Delores to say yes]

Delores: Now…now, if'n you wanted to save everything so we could date a bit, see how things go, well, I’d be up for that.

S'tonge: Will you marry me, and have a universe? Yes or no?

Sparks: Um, say yes. That is my advice. Say yes.

Delores: Well now, you’re omniscient, you already know my answer.

Sparks: Is it yes? Is it? Is it yes?

S'tonge: I don’t know, actually. I’m being respectful. Laying a solid groundwork for this relationship.

Delores: By blackmailing me with the fate of the universe?

S'tonge: By not peeking.

Delores: The answer…is…no.

S'tonge: Fine. Have a good end of the universe, you guys.

Sparks: Seriously?

Sparks: That ended poorly.

Steve: What was wrong with that guy?

Sparks: Yeah, that was bad.

Steve: I mean…

Delores: Love is what was wrong with him.

Sparks: Yeah, the bad kind of love. How long anyone reckon we got?

Claxon: End’s startin’. My ocular sensors are telling me the moon’s nearly gone.

Pemily: Oh, dumb old time travelin’! Nothin’ good never came from it.

Sparks and Cecil: Wait…

Claxon and Steve: What [is it]?

Sparks: If'n too much time travel caused this disaster…

Cecil: Then it stands to reason that we can fix it the same way.

Croach: That is unsound reasoning.

Carlos: Yeah. And that makes no scientific sense.

Cecil: No, listen, it does!

Sparks: It does. We still got time travel in our pocket, or Deputy County’s, more specifically.

Cecil: She can go back!

Delores: Yeah, but if I go back, I’ll destroy everything!

Sparks: Unless you go to before this all happened…

Cecil: And stop it all from ever happening.

[Sound of two palms slapping together]

Cecil: That was my very first high five!

Sparks: Well, you are great at it.

Cecil: Thank you!

Steve: Wait, wait, wait! If that happens, then none of us would ever have met!

Cecil: I am 100% OK with that. [Perhaps a “No offense” under his breath – I didn’t hear it but it works with Sparks’ next line.]

Sparks: None taken. All right, let’s do it. And by “let’s,” I mean “you.”

Delores: Yeah. Yeah, I think I can do that. But…I may never come back. Marshal Stallwark, may I tender my resignation?

Carlos: Guys! This won’t work, according to science, OK? If no one’s going to listen to science, I’m just going to project myself back into the Otherworld desert dimension, where I live. OK? Good luck, Delores. I’m sure you’ll be fine. Cyborgs are always fine. I’ll talk to you again soon, Cecil.

Cecil: All right. I love you.

Carlos: I love you, too.

Pemily: I, uh, I…accept your resignation, deputy.

Delores: Love you too, boss.

Croach: And I…lo–

Sparks: Save it. Yup.

Cecil? It’s been interesting getting to meet you. You got a soothing voice, and I think that helped folk. Also, you got a lot of heart.

Cecil: Well, tha–

Sparks: Not as much as me, but you got plenty of heart.

Cecil: And this was all like being in a western! You know, I also love every film that Lee Marvin has made. Howdy adios Marshal! Howdy adios.

Sparks: What? Those are two tot– All right. Bye.

Delores: Diverting power…to do this. Won’t…be…silent.

[Sound of time travel stuff happening]

Sparks: Felton! What kind of trouble?

Felton: What kind of trouble? The worst kind! Robot outlaws! Also a human who ain’t a robot, but who is an outlaw. I runned out soon as they started talking about gunnin’ for you, Marshal! So’s you’d have enough time to prepare yourself for their eventual arrival here! At…

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Claxon: Which one of you flesh and bone and blood and nerves and organs-havin’ so-and-sos is Sparks Nevady, Marshal on Mars?

[Sound of something violent happening, accompanied by screams of surprise and pain from Claxon and Samuel]

Dan: Well, there you go. I lured these robot outlaws here to be destroyed for the bounty.

Sparks: So…wait, you two are working together?

Delores: I come from a possible future, Marshal Nevada. And now I have prevented that future.

Sparks: Yeah, OK, I’m just gonna take that at face value.

Dan: So you ain’t interested in the bounty?

Delores: Then the bounty’s mine! Use it to open up a shoe business, I reckon.

Sparks: All right! I’ll fill out the paperwork. Credit should be in your account by end of business today.

Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.

Croach: I also will leave.

Sparks: For good, then?

Croach: Yes. I shall depart. Unless you are somehow responsible for the cyborg having prevented a destructive future.

Sparks: I’m…sure I’m not.

Delores: Um, you kind of were.

Sparks: Uh, no, uh, uh, no. I’m sure it wasn’t that destructive of a future.

Delores: Ehh, universe-ending level destructive.

Sparks: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I’m sure you did most of the work.

Delores: Based on your idea!

Sparks: Oh, come on!

Croach: Then I am under great onus to you, Sparks Nevada. I will discern just how great via an accounting of what occurred.

Delores: [Sigh] And then afterwards, reckon I’ll go to the moon and resume deputying. Except…there’s another me doing my job. The me that never left. I don’t wanna start paradoxing again. Ugh. If I could do anything, what would I do?

Sparks: Hmm.

Delores: Shoe maker!

Sparks: What?

Delores: What? Where’d that come from?

Sparks: You know, that’s what Nice Man Dan did before, and what he’s liable to do again.

Delores: Nice Man Dan, huh?

Sparks: Yeah.

Delores: He’s nice. Real nice.

S'tonge: Nice Man Dan, huh? She winds up with Nice Man Dan? Makin’ shoes? Fine.

And is this the end of Sparks Nevada? Has he endured a visit from past persons only to find the timeline unchanged?

Well, guess I’ll just keep watching and…

Colonel Tick-Tock: Wait, darling!

S'tonge: Colonel Tick-Tock, bulwark of Her Majesty’s Royal Chronal Patrol!

Cecil: And me, Cecil Palmer!

Dana: And me, mayor of Night Vale, Dana Cardinal.

Tick-Tock: Her Majesty’s timeline has been driven dangerously weird, S'tonge. And only the four of us can repair it.

Cecil: And we know weird.

Dana: I;m basically the mayor of weird.

S'tonge: But…but why are y'all here? What happens in this timeline? Do I become a giant jerk or something?

Cecil: Oh, not you, S'tonge. It’s your kids! Something must be done about your kids!

S'tonge: What about 'em?

Cecil: You’re not supposed to have any!

Dana: It could ruin everything!

Tick-Tock: You must end up alone and bitter!

S'tonge: Great! Then let’s go!

Wait…where’s your trick clock?

Tick-Tock: Trick clock? Where we’re going, we don’t need trick clocks.

S'tonge: Is…is that a DeLorean?

Cecil: Yes, yes it is.

S'tonge: Cool!

[Tires screeching]

[Also at this point I decide to stop trying to figure out who is speaking at which points since the story is over]
